# Quote of the Day â€“ Random Quote GeneratorðŸŽ¯

I developed a Random Quote Generator web app that displays a new inspirational quote each time the user clicks a button. It's a simple yet engaging project that demonstrates how JavaScript can dynamically interact with the DOM.

# Key Features:ðŸ”‘

âœ… Responsive design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

âœ… Random quote generation using vanilla JavaScript.

âœ… Clean and user-friendly interface with smooth interactions.

# This project helped me practice:

-DOM manipulation

-Event listeners

-Array handling and randomization
